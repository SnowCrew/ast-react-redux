        Get tired of Lorem ipsum data?! Didn't you find any free e-commerce
        API?! fakeStoreApi is a free online REST API that you can use whenever
        you need Pseudo-real data for your e-commerce or shopping website
        without running any server-side code. It's awesome for teaching
        purposes, sample codes, tests, etc.
